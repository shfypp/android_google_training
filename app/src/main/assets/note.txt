Starting an Activity

    1.  Lifecycle Callbacks
        onCreate()      onStart()       onResume()
                Created         Started           Resumed           Paused
                                       visible          visible           partially visible

         onPause()              onStop()            onDestroy
                 Paused                 Stopped              Destoryed
                       partially visible       hiden


        onCreate()  -onStart()  -onResume() -onPause()  -onStop()       -onDestory()
                                            -onResume()
                                                        -onRestart()    -onStart()
    2.  three states an activity can exist
        Resumed
        Pasued
        Stopped

Pausing an Activity

    1.  You should usually use the onPause() callback to:
        ●   Stop animations or other ongoing actions that could consume CPU.
        ●   Commit unsaved changes,but only if users expect such changes to be permanently(永久地)
            saved when they leave(such as a draft email)
        ●   Release system resources,such as broadcast receiver,handles to sensors(传感器),
            or any resources that may affect battery life while your activity is paused
            and the user dose not need them.
    2.  You should avoid performing CPU-intensive work during onPause(),such as
        writing to a database,because it can show the visible transition to the next activity(
        you should instead perform heavy-load shutdown operations during onStop())

Resuming an Activity
    1.  You should implement onResume() to initialize components that you release during onPause()
        and perform any other initialization that must occur each time the activity
        enters the Resumed state(such as begin animations and initialize components
        only used while the activity has user focus)

Stopping an Activity
    1.  Although the onPause() method is called before onStop(),you should use onStop()
        to perform lager、more CPU intensive shut-down operations, such as
        writing information to a database.
    2.  Even if the system destroys your activity while it's stopped,it still retains
        the state of the View objects(such as text in an EditText) in a Bundle

Start/Restart an Activity
    1.  The onRestart() method is called only when the activity resumes from the stopped state,
        so you can use it to perform special restoration work that might be necessary
        only if the activity was previously stopped, but not destroyed.

Recreating an Activity
    1.  To save additional state information for your activity,you must
        implement onSaveInstanceState() and add key-value pairs to the Bundle object.
