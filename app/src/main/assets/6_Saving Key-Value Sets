Saving Key-Value Sets
    1.  You can create a new shared preference file or access an existing one by
        calling one of two methods:
        ●   getSharePreferences()-Use this if you need multiple shared preference files
            identified by name,which you specify with the first parameter.You can call this
            from any Context in your app.
        ●   getPreferences()-Use this from an Activity if you need to use only one shared
            preference file for the activity.Because this retrieves a defaults shared preference
            file that belongs to the activity,you don't need to supply a name.
